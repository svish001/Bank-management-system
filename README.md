# Bank-management-system
A Java-based Bank Management System

 Overview
The Bank Management System is a comprehensive Java-based banking application that provides dual interfaces for both administrators and clients. This system simulates a real banking environment where clients can manage their accounts and transactions, while administrators can oversee branch operations and manage customer data. The application features real-time transaction processing, secure database integration, and a user-friendly interface for both user types.
